- Find a way to protect yourself from zip bombs

- from django's site: "If you are serving your own static files, be sure that handlers like Apache’s mod_php, which would execute static files as code, are disabled. You don’t want users to be able to execute arbitrary code by uploading and requesting a specially crafted file."
Make sure mod_php is disabled of the apache server on the vm

- check the filetype client-side maybe? We can reject non-zip files.

- better error message when file fails to unzip

--- future work:
We can have a distributed task queue when server runs under heavy load.
As much as possible analysis should be offloaded to the client. Waiting for the JS tools to be ready at the lab!
Django is not the best choice backend application. This should be replaced with node.
