- Find a way to protect yourself from zip bombs

- from django's site: "If you are serving your own static files, be sure that handlers like Apache’s mod_php, which would execute static files as code, are disabled. You don’t want users to be able to execute arbitrary code by uploading and requesting a specially crafted file."
Make sure mod_php is disabled of the apache server on the vm

- check the filetype client-side maybe? We can reject non-zip files.

- better error message when file fails to unzip

- I have a strong suspicion that due to the way react works, we might be creating a new ace editor for every file we ever open. This is a memory leak, and could be worth fixing if this starts becoming a memory hog.
